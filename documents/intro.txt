Project Aiden: The Definitive MCP-Integrated Build Manual

Project Aiden is a privacy-focused, high-performance smart home AI system built on a service-oriented architecture. The system uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create independent, containerized microservices that communicate via standardized HTTP/SSE transport.

Core Principles:
1. Privacy - Local-first processing, no cloud dependencies for critical functions
2. Performance - Dedicated hardware for AI inference and low-latency interactions
3. Personalization - Infinite customization and learning capabilities

The architecture consists of:
- AI Workhorse (GMKtec K8 Plus) - Powerful mini-PC for heavy computation
- Control & Integration Hub (Raspberry Pi 5) - Real-time device control running Home Assistant
- Multiple satellite devices for distributed sensing and interaction

All services expose their capabilities as MCP tools, allowing seamless integration and orchestration.
